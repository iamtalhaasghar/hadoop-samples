australia  officially the commonwealth of australia  is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the australian continent  the island of tasmania  and numerous smaller islands  13  it is the largest country in oceania and the world s sixth largest country by total area  the population of 26 million 7  is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard  14  australia s capital is canberra  and its largest city is sydney  the country s other major metropolitan areas are melbourne  brisbane  perth  and adelaide 
indigenous australians inhabited the continent for about 65 000 years 15  prior to the first arrival of dutch explorers in the early 17th century  who named it new holland  in 1770  australia s eastern half was claimed by great britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of new south wales from 26 january 1788  a date which became australia s national day  the population grew steadily in subsequent decades  and by the time of an 1850s gold rush  most of the continent had been explored by european settlers and an additional five self governing crown colonies established  on 1 january 1901  the six colonies federated  forming the commonwealth of australia  australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy  comprising six states and ten territories 
australia is the oldest  16  flattest  17  and driest inhabited continent  18  19  with the least fertile soils  20  21  it has a landmass of 7 617 930 square kilometres  2 941 300 sq mi   22  a megadiverse country  its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates  with deserts in the centre  tropical rainforests in the north east  and mountain ranges in the south east  australia generates its income from various sources  including mining related exports  telecommunications  banking  manufacturing  and international education  23  24  25 
australia is a developed country  with the world s thirteenth largest economy and tenth highest per capita income  26  it is considered a regional power and has the world s thirteenth highest military expenditure  27  immigrants account for 30  of the population  28  the highest proportion in any country with a population over 10 million  29  the country ranks highly in measures of health  education  economic freedom  and civil liberties  30

the name australia  pronounced  ??stre?li?  in australian english 31   is derived from the latin terra australis   southern land    a name used for a hypothetical continent in the southern hemisphere since ancient times  32  when europeans first began visiting and mapping australia in the 17th century  the name terra australis was naturally applied to the new territories  n 5 
until the early 19th century  australia was best known as  new holland   a name first applied by the dutch explorer abel tasman in 1644  as nieuw holland  and subsequently anglicised  terra australis still saw occasional usage  such as in scientific texts  n 6  the name australia was popularised by the explorer matthew flinders  who said it was  more agreeable to the ear  and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth   38  several famous early cartographers also made use of the word australia on maps  gerardus mercator  1512 1594  used the phrase climata australia on his double cordiform map of the world of 1538  as did gemma frisius  1508 1555   who was mercator s teacher and collaborator  on his own cordiform wall map in 1540  australia appears in a book on astronomy by cyriaco jacob zum barth published in frankfurt am main in 1545  39 
the first time that australia appears to have been officially used was in april 1817  when governor lachlan macquarie acknowledged the receipt of flinders  charts of australia from lord bathurst  40  in december 1817  macquarie recommended to the colonial office that it be formally adopted  41  in 1824  the admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name  42  the first official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of the australia directory by the hydrographic office  43 
colloquial names for australia include  oz  and  the land down under   usually shortened to just  down under    other epithets include  the great southern land    the lucky country    the sunburnt country   and  the wide brown land   the latter two both derive from dorothea mackellar s 1908 poem  my country   44 
human habitation of the australian continent is known to have begun at least 65 000 years ago  45  46  with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now southeast asia  47  the madjedbebe rock shelter in arnhem land is recognised as the oldest site showing the presence of humans in australia  48  the oldest human remains found are the lake mungo remains  which have been dated to around 41 000 years ago  49  50  these people were the ancestors of modern indigenous australians  51  aboriginal australian culture is one of the oldest continual cultures on earth  52 
at the time of first european contact  most indigenous australians were hunter gatherers with complex economies and societies  53  54  recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 750 000 could have been sustained  55  56  indigenous australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the dreamtime  57  the torres strait islanders  ethnically melanesian  obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas  58  the northern coasts and waters of australia were visited sporadically by makassan fishermen from what is now indonesia  59 
the first recorded european sighting of the australian mainland  and the first recorded european landfall on the australian continent  are attributed to the dutch  60  the first ship and crew to chart the australian coast and meet with aboriginal people was the duyfken captained by dutch navigator  willem janszoon  61  he sighted the coast of cape york peninsula in early 1606  and made landfall on 26 february at the pennefather river near the modern town of weipa on cape york  62  later that year  spanish explorer luís vaz de torres sailed through  and navigated  torres strait islands  63  the dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent  new holland  during the 17th century  and although no attempt at settlement was made  62  a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or  as in the case of the batavia in 1629  marooned for mutiny and murder  thus becoming the first europeans to permanently inhabit the continent  64  william dampier  an english explorer and privateer  landed on the north west coast of new holland in 1688  while serving as a crewman under pirate captain john read 65   and again in 1699 on a return trip  66  in 1770  james cook sailed along and mapped the east coast  which he named new south wales and claimed for great britain  67 
with the loss of its american colonies in 1783  the british government sent a fleet of ships  the  first fleet   under the command of captain arthur phillip  to establish a new penal colony in new south wales  a camp was set up and the union flag raised at sydney cove  port jackson  on 26 january 1788  68  69  a date which later became australia s national day  australia day  most early convicts were transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants upon arrival  while the majority settled into colonial society once emancipated  convict rebellions and uprisings were also staged  but invariably suppressed under martial law  the 1808 rum rebellion  the only successful armed takeover of government in australia  instigated a two year period of military rule  70 
the indigenous population declined for 150 years following settlement  mainly due to infectious disease  71  thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers  72  a government policy of  assimilation  beginning with the aboriginal protection act 1869 resulted in the removal of many aboriginal children from their families and communities referred to as the stolen generations a practice which also contributed to the decline in the indigenous population  73  as a result of the 1967 referendum  the federal government s power to enact special laws with respect to a particular race was extended to enable the making of laws with respect to aboriginals  74  traditional ownership of land   native title   was not recognised in law until 1992  when the high court of australia held in mabo v queensland  no 2  that the legal doctrine that australia had been terra nullius   land belonging to no one   did not apply to australia at the time of british settlement  75 
the expansion of british control over other areas of the continent began in the early 19th century  initially confined to coastal regions  a settlement was established in van diemen s land  present day tasmania  in 1803  and it became a separate colony in 1825  76  in 1813  gregory blaxland  william lawson and william wentworth crossed the blue mountains west of sydney  opening the interior to european settlement  77  the british claim was extended to the whole australian continent in 1827 when major edmund lockyer established a settlement on king george sound  modern day albany  western australia   78  the swan river colony was established in 1829  evolving into the largest australian colony by area  western australia  79  in accordance with population growth  separate colonies were carved from parts of new south wales  south australia in 1836  new zealand in 1841  victoria in 1851  and queensland in 1859  80  the northern territory was excised from south australia in 1911  81  south australia was founded as a  free province  it was never a penal colony  82  western australia was also founded  free  but later accepted transported convicts  the last of which arrived in 1868  decades after transportation had ceased to the other colonies  83  by 1850  europeans still had not entered large areas of the inland  explorers remained ambitious to discover new lands for agriculture or answers to scientific enquiries  84 
a series of gold rushes beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from china  north america and mainland europe  85  and also spurred outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest  the latter peaked in 1854 when ballarat miners launched the eureka rebellion against gold license fees  86  between 1855 and 1890  the six colonies individually gained responsible government  managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the british empire  87  the colonial office in london retained control of some matters  notably foreign affairs  88  defence  89  and international shipping 
on 1 january 1901  federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning  consultation and voting  90  after the 1907 imperial conference  australia and the other self governing british colonies were given the status of  dominion  within the british empire  91  92  the federal capital territory  later renamed the australian capital territory  was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of canberra  melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while canberra was being constructed  93  the northern territory was transferred from the control of the south australian government to the federal parliament in 1911  94  australia became the colonial ruler of the territory of papua  which had initially been annexed by queensland in 1888  in 1902 and of the territory of new guinea  formerly german new guinea  in 1920  the two were unified as the territory of papua and new guinea in 1949 and gained independence from australia in 1975 
in 1914  australia joined britain in fighting world war i  with support from both the outgoing commonwealth liberal party and the incoming australian labor party  95  96  australians took part in many of the major battles fought on the western front  97  of about 416 000 who served  about 60 000 were killed and another 152 000 were wounded  98  many australians regard the defeat of the australian and new zealand army corps  anzacs  at gallipoli as the birth of the nation its first major military action  99  100  the kokoda track campaign is regarded by many as an analogous nation defining event during world war ii  101 
britain s statute of westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between australia and the uk  australia adopted it in 1942  102  but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the australian parliament during world war ii  103  104  the shock of britain s defeat in asia in 1942  followed soon after by the bombing of darwin and other japanese attacks  led to a widespread belief in australia that an invasion was imminent  and a shift towards the united states as a new ally and protector  105  since 1951  australia has been a formal military ally of the us  under the anzus treaty  106 
after world war ii  australia encouraged immigration from mainland europe  since the 1970s and following the abolition of the white australia policy  immigration from asia and elsewhere was also promoted  107  as a result  australia s demography  culture  and self image were transformed  108  the australia act 1986 severed the remaining constitutional ties between australia and the uk  109  in a 1999 referendum  55  of voters and a majority in every state rejected a proposal to become a republic with a president appointed by a two thirds vote in both houses of the australian parliament  there has been an increasing focus in foreign policy on ties with other pacific rim nations while maintaining close ties with australia s traditional allies and trading partners  110 
surrounded by the indian and pacific oceans  n 7  australia is separated from asia by the arafura and timor seas  with the coral sea lying off the queensland coast  and the tasman sea lying between australia and new zealand  the world s smallest continent 112  and sixth largest country by total area  113  australia owing to its size and isolation is often dubbed the  island continent  114  and is sometimes considered the world s largest island  115  australia has 34 218 kilometres  21 262 mi  of coastline  excluding all offshore islands   116  and claims an extensive exclusive economic zone of 8 148 250 square kilometres  3 146 060 sq mi   this exclusive economic zone does not include the australian antarctic territory  117  apart from macquarie island  australia lies between latitudes 9  and 44 s  and longitudes 112  and 154 e 
australia s size gives it a wide variety of landscapes  with tropical rainforests in the north east  mountain ranges in the south east  south west and east  and desert in the centre  118  the desert or semi arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land  119  australia is the driest inhabited continent  its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500 mm  120  the population density is 3 2 inhabitants per square kilometre  although a large proportion of the population lives along the temperate south eastern coastline  121 
the great barrier reef  the world s largest coral reef  122  lies a short distance off the north east coast and extends for over 2 000 kilometres  1 240 mi   mount augustus  claimed to be the world s largest monolith  123  is located in western australia  at 2 228 metres  7 310 ft   mount kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the australian mainland  even taller are mawson peak  at 2 745 metres or 9 006 feet   on the remote australian external territory of heard island  and  in the australian antarctic territory  mount mcclintock and mount menzies  at 3 492 metres  11 457 ft  and 3 355 metres  11 007 ft  respectively  124 
eastern australia is marked by the great dividing range  which runs parallel to the coast of queensland  new south wales and much of victoria  the name is not strictly accurate  because parts of the range consist of low hills  and the highlands are typically no more than 1 600 metres  5 249 ft  in height  125  the coastal uplands and a belt of brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains  while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland and shrubland  125  126  these include the western plains of new south wales  and the mitchell grass downs and mulga lands of inland queensland  127  128  129  130  the northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical cape york peninsula 
the landscapes of the top end and the gulf country with their tropical climate include forest  woodland  wetland  grassland  rainforest and desert  131  132  133  at the north west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of the kimberley  and below that the pilbara  the victoria plains tropical savanna lies south of the kimberly and arnhem land savannas  forming a transition between the coastal savannas and the interior deserts  134  135  136  at the heart of the country are the uplands of central australia  prominent features of the centre and south include uluru  also known as ayers rock   the famous sandstone monolith  and the inland simpson  tirari and sturt stony  gibson  great sandy  tanami  and great victoria deserts  with the famous nullarbor plain on the southern coast  137  138  139  140  the western australian mulga shrublands lie between the interior deserts and mediterranean climate southwest australia  139  141 
lying on the indo australian plate  the mainland of australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on earth with a relatively stable geological history  142  143  the landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over 3 8 billion years of the earth s history  the pilbara craton is one of only two pristine archaean 3 6 2 7 ga  billion years ago  crusts identified on the earth  144 
having been part of all major supercontinents  the australian continent began to form after the breakup of gondwana in the permian  with the separation of the continental landmass from the african continent and indian subcontinent  it separated from antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the permian and continuing through to the cretaceous  145  when the last glacial period ended in about 10 000 bc  rising sea levels formed bass strait  separating tasmania from the mainland  then between about 8 000 and 6 500 bc  the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea  separating new guinea  the aru islands  and the mainland of australia  146  the australian continent is moving toward eurasia at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a year  147 
the australian mainland s continental crust  excluding the thinned margins  has an average thickness of 38 km  with a range in thickness from 24 km to 59 km  148  australia s geology can be divided into several main sections  showcasing that the continent grew from west to east  the archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west  proterozoic fold belts in the centre and phanerozoic sedimentary basins  metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east  149 
the australian mainland and tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and have no active volcanoes  150  but due to passing over the east australia hotspot  recent volcanism has occurred during the holocene  in the newer volcanics province of western victoria and southeastern south australia  volcanism also occurs in the island of new guinea  considered geologically as part of the australian continent   and in the australian external territory of heard island and mcdonald islands  151  seismic activity in the australian mainland and tasmania is also low  with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the 1989 newcastle earthquake  152 
the climate of australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents  including the indian ocean dipole and the el niño southern oscillation  which is correlated with periodic drought  and the seasonal tropical low pressure system that produces cyclones in northern australia  154  155  these factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year  much of the northern part of the country has a tropical  predominantly summer rainfall  monsoon   120  the south west corner of the country has a mediterranean climate  156  the south east ranges from oceanic  tasmania and coastal victoria  to humid subtropical  upper half of new south wales   with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates  the interior is arid to semi arid  120 
driven by climate change  average temperatures have risen more than 1 c since 1960  associated changes in rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues such as drought and bushfires  2019 was australia s warmest recorded year  157  and the 2019 20 bushfire season was the country s worst on record  158  australia s greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world  159 
water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought  160  161  throughout much of the continent  major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought  flushing out inland river systems  overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains  as occurred throughout eastern australia in 2010  2011 and 2012 after the 2000s australian drought 
although most of australia is semi arid or desert  the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests  fungi typify that diversity an estimated 250 000 species of which only 5  have been described occur in australia  162  because of the continent s great age  extremely variable weather patterns  and long term geographic isolation  much of australia s biota is unique  about 85  of flowering plants  84  of mammals  more than 45  of birds  and 89  of in shore  temperate zone fish are endemic  163  australia has at least 755 species of reptile  more than any other country in the world  164  besides antarctica  australia is the only continent that developed without feline species  feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by dutch shipwrecks  and later in the 18th century by european settlers  they are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species  165  australia is also one of 17 megadiverse countries 
australian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species  particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions  wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts  166  among well known australian animals are the monotremes  the platypus and echidna   a host of marsupials  including the kangaroo  koala  and wombat  and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra  166  australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world  167  the dingo was introduced by austronesian people who traded with indigenous australians around 3000 bce  168  many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement  169  including the australian megafauna  others have disappeared since european settlement  among them the thylacine  170  171 
many of australia s ecoregions  and the species within those regions  are threatened by human activities and introduced animal  chromistan  fungal and plant species  172  all these factors have led to australia s having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world  173  the federal environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999 is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species  174  numerous protected areas have been created under the national strategy for the conservation of australia s biological diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems  175  176  65 wetlands are listed under the ramsar convention  177  and 16 natural world heritage sites have been established  178  australia was ranked 21st out of 178 countries in the world on the 2018 environmental performance index  179  there are more than 1 800 animals and plants on australia s threatened species list  including more than 500 animals  180 
australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy  181  the country has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system under its constitution  which is one of the world s oldest  since federation in 1901  it is also one of the world s oldest federations  in which power is divided between the federal and state and territorial governments  the australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the united kingdom  a fused executive  constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline  and the united states  federalism  a written constitution and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house   along with distinctive indigenous features  182  183 
the federal government is separated into three branches 
elizabeth ii reigns as queen of australia and is represented in australia by the governor general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level  who by convention act on the advice of her ministers  185  186  thus  in practice the governor general acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the federal executive council  the governor general does have extraordinary reserve powers which may be exercised outside the prime minister s request in rare and limited circumstances  the most notable exercise of which was the dismissal of the whitlam government in the constitutional crisis of 1975  187 
in the senate  the upper house   there are 76 senators  twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories  the australian capital territory and the northern territory   188  the house of representatives  the lower house  has 151 members elected from single member electoral divisions  commonly known as  electorates  or  seats   allocated to states on the basis of population  189  with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats  190  elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously  senators have overlapping six year terms except for those from the territories  whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house  thus only 40 of the 76 places in the senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution  188 
australia s electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of tasmania and the act which  along with the senate and most state upper houses  combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote  voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction  191  as is enrolment  with the exception of south australia   192  the party with majority support in the house of representatives forms the government and its leader becomes prime minister  in cases where no party has majority support  the governor general has the constitutional power to appoint the prime minister and  if necessary  dismiss one that has lost the confidence of parliament  193 
there are two major political groups that usually form government  federally and in the states  the australian labor party and the coalition which is a formal grouping of the liberal party and its minor partner  the national party  194  195  within australian political culture  the coalition is considered centre right and the labor party is considered centre left  196  independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in australian parliaments  mostly in upper houses  the australian greens are often considered the  third force  in politics  being the third largest party by both vote and membership  197 
the most recent federal election was held on 18 may 2019 and resulted in the coalition  led by prime minister scott morrison  retaining government  198 
australia has six states new south wales  nsw   queensland  qld   south australia  sa   tasmania  tas   victoria  vic  and western australia  wa  and two major mainland territories the australian capital territory  act  and the northern territory  nt   in most respects  these two territories function as states  except that the commonwealth parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments  199 
under the constitution  the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject  whereas the commonwealth  federal  parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section 51  for example  state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education  criminal law and state police  health  transport  and local government  but the commonwealth parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas  200  however  commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency  201  in addition  the commonwealth has the power to levy income tax which  coupled with the power to make grants to states  has given it the financial means to incentivise states to pursue specific legislative agendas within areas over which the commonwealth does not have legislative power 
each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament unicameral in the northern territory  the act and queensland  and bicameral in the other states  the states are sovereign entities  although subject to certain powers of the commonwealth as defined by the constitution  the lower houses are known as the legislative assembly  the house of assembly in south australia and tasmania   the upper houses are known as the legislative council  the head of the government in each state is the premier and in each territory the chief minister  the queen is represented in each state by a governor  and in the northern territory  the administrator  202  in the commonwealth  the queen s representative is the governor general  203 
the commonwealth parliament also directly administers the external territories of ashmore and cartier islands  christmas island  the cocos  keeling  islands  the coral sea islands  heard island and mcdonald islands  and the claimed region of australian antarctic territory  as well as the internal jervis bay territory  a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of new south wales  184  the external territory of norfolk island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the norfolk island act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an administrator to represent the queen  204  in 2015  the commonwealth parliament abolished self government  integrating norfolk island into the australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council  205  macquarie island is part of tasmania  206  and lord howe island of new south wales  207 
over recent decades  australia s foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the united states through the anzus pact  and by a desire to develop relationships with asia and the pacific  particularly through asean  the pacific islands forum and the pacific community  of which australia is a founding member  in 2005 australia secured an inaugural seat at the east asia summit following its accession to the treaty of amity and cooperation in southeast asia  and in 2011 attended the sixth east asia summit in indonesia  australia is a member of the commonwealth of nations  in which the commonwealth heads of government meetings provide the main forum for co operation  208  australia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation  209  it led the formation of the cairns group and asia pacific economic cooperation  210  211 
australia is a member of the organisation for economic co operation and development and the world trade organization  212  213  and has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements  most recently the australia united states free trade agreement 214  and closer economic relations with new zealand  215  with another free trade agreement being negotiated with china the australia china free trade agreement and japan  216  south korea in 2011  217  218  australia chile free trade agreement  and as of november 2015 update  has put the trans pacific partnership before parliament for ratification  219 
australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring new zealand  with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the trans tasman travel arrangement and free trade under the australia new zealand closer economic relations trade agreement  220  new zealand  canada and the united kingdom are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by australian people  221  222
