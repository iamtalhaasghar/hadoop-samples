modern humans arrived on the indian subcontinent from africa no later than 55 000 years ago  24  their long occupation  initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter gatherers  has made the region highly diverse  second only to africa in human genetic diversity  25  settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the indus river basin 9 000 years ago  evolving gradually into the indus valley civilisation of the third millennium bce  26  by 1200 bce  an archaic form of sanskrit  an indo european language  had diffused into india from the northwest  unfolding as the language of the rigveda  and recording the dawning of hinduism in india  27  the dravidian languages of india were supplanted in the northern and western regions  28  by 400 bce  stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within hinduism  29  and buddhism and jainism had arisen  proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity  30  early political consolidations gave rise to the loose knit maurya and gupta empires based in the ganges basin  31  their collective era was suffused with wide ranging creativity  32  but also marked by the declining status of women  33  and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief  g  34  in south india  the middle kingdoms exported dravidian languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of southeast asia  35 
in the early medieval era  christianity  islam  judaism  and zoroastrianism put down roots on india s southern and western coasts  36  muslim armies from central asia intermittently overran india s northern plains  37  eventually establishing the delhi sultanate  and drawing northern india into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval islam  38  in the 15th century  the vijayanagara empire created a long lasting composite hindu culture in south india  39  in the punjab  sikhism emerged  rejecting institutionalised religion  40  the mughal empire  in 1526  ushered in two centuries of relative peace  41  leaving a legacy of luminous architecture  h  42  gradually expanding rule of the british east india company followed  turning india into a colonial economy  but also consolidating its sovereignty  43  british crown rule began in 1858  the rights promised to indians were granted slowly  44  but technological changes were introduced  and ideas of education  modernity and the public life took root  45  a pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged  which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending british rule  46  in 1947 the british indian empire was partitioned into two independent dominions  a hindu majority dominion of india and a muslim majority dominion of pakistan  amid large scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration  47  48 
india has been a secular federal republic since 1950  governed in a democratic parliamentary system  it is a pluralistic  multilingual and multi ethnic society  india s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1 211 billion in 2011  49  during the same time  its nominal per capita income increased from us 64 annually to us 1 498  and its literacy rate from 16 6  to 74   from being a comparatively destitute country in 1951  50  india has become a fast growing major economy and a hub for information technology services  with an expanding middle class  51  it has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions  indian movies  music  and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture  52  india has substantially reduced its rate of poverty  though at the cost of increasing economic inequality  53  india is a nuclear weapon state  which ranks high in military expenditure  it has disputes over kashmir with its neighbours  pakistan and china  unresolved since the mid 20th century  54  among the socio economic challenges india faces are gender inequality  child malnutrition  55  and rising levels of air pollution  56  india s land is megadiverse  with four biodiversity hotspots  57  its forest cover comprises 21 4  of its area  58  india s wildlife  which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in india s culture  59  is supported among these forests  and elsewhere  in protected habitats 
according to the oxford english dictionary  third edition 2009   the name  india  is derived from the classical latin india  a reference to south asia and an uncertain region to its east  and in turn derived successively from  hellenistic greek india   ?????   ancient greek indos   ?????   old persian hindush  an eastern province of the achaemenid empire  and ultimately its cognate  the sanskrit sindhu  or  river   specifically the indus river and  by implication  its well settled southern basin  60  61  the ancient greeks referred to the indians as indoi  ?????   which translates as  the people of the indus   62 
the term bharat  bh?rat  pronounced  ?b?a???t   listen    mentioned in both indian epic poetry and the constitution of india  63  64  is used in its variations by many indian languages  a modern rendering of the historical name bharatavarsha  which applied originally to a region of the gangetic valley  65  66  bharat gained increased currency from the mid 19th century as a native name for india  63  67 
hindustan   ??nd??sta?n   listen   is a middle persian name for india  introduced during the mughal empire and used widely since  its meaning has varied  referring to a region encompassing present day northern india and pakistan or to india in its near entirety  63  67  68 
by 55 000 years ago  the first modern humans  or homo sapiens  had arrived on the indian subcontinent from africa  where they had earlier evolved  69  70  71  the earliest known modern human remains in south asia date to about 30 000 years ago  72  after 6500 bce  evidence for domestication of food crops and animals  construction of permanent structures  and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in mehrgarh and other sites in what is now balochistan  pakistan  73  these gradually developed into the indus valley civilisation  74  73  the first urban culture in south asia  75  which flourished during 2500 1900 bce in what is now pakistan and western india  76  centred around cities such as mohenjo daro  harappa  dholavira  and kalibangan  and relying on varied forms of subsistence  the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide ranging trade  75 
during the period 2000 500 bce  many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the chalcolithic cultures to the iron age ones  77  the vedas  the oldest scriptures associated with hinduism  78  were composed during this period  79  and historians have analysed these to posit a vedic culture in the punjab region and the upper gangetic plain  77  most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of indo aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north west  78  the caste system  which created a hierarchy of priests  warriors  and free peasants  but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure  arose during this period  80  on the deccan plateau  archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation  77  in south india  a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period  81  as well as by nearby traces of agriculture  irrigation tanks  and craft traditions  81 
in the late vedic period  around the 6th century bce  the small states and chiefdoms of the ganges plain and the north western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas  82  83  the emerging urbanisation gave rise to non vedic religious movements  two of which became independent religions  jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar  mahavira  84  buddhism  based on the teachings of gautama buddha  attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class  chronicling the life of the buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in india  85  86  87  in an age of increasing urban wealth  both religions held up renunciation as an ideal  88  and both established long lasting monastic traditions  politically  by the 3rd century bce  the kingdom of magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the mauryan empire  89  the empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south  but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas  90  91  the mauryan kings are known as much for their empire building and determined management of public life as for ashoka s renunciation of militarism and far flung advocacy of the buddhist dhamma  92  93 
the sangam literature of the tamil language reveals that  between 200 bce and 200 ce  the southern peninsula was ruled by the cheras  the cholas  and the pandyas  dynasties that traded extensively with the roman empire and with west and south east asia  94  95  in north india  hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family  leading to increased subordination of women  96  89  by the 4th and 5th centuries  the gupta empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater ganges plain  this system became a model for later indian kingdoms  97  98  under the guptas  a renewed hinduism based on devotion  rather than the management of ritual  began to assert itself  99  this renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture  which found patrons among an urban elite  98  classical sanskrit literature flowered as well  and indian science  astronomy  medicine  and mathematics made significant advances  98 
the indian early medieval age  600 ce to 1200 ce  is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity  100  when harsha of kannauj  who ruled much of the indo gangetic plain from 606 to 647 ce  attempted to expand southwards  he was defeated by the chalukya ruler of the deccan  101  when his successor attempted to expand eastwards  he was defeated by the pala king of bengal  101  when the chalukyas attempted to expand southwards  they were defeated by the pallavas from farther south  who in turn were opposed by the pandyas and the cholas from still farther south  101  no ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region  100  during this time  pastoral peoples  whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy  were accommodated within caste society  as were new non traditional ruling classes  102  the caste system consequently began to show regional differences  102 
in the 6th and 7th centuries  the first devotional hymns were created in the tamil language  103  they were imitated all over india and led to both the resurgence of hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent  103  indian royalty  big and small  and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities  which became economic hubs as well  104  temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as india underwent another urbanisation  104  by the 8th and 9th centuries  the effects were felt in south east asia  as south indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern day myanmar  thailand  laos  cambodia  vietnam  philippines  malaysia  and java  105  indian merchants  scholars  and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission  south east asians took the initiative as well  with many sojourning in indian seminaries and translating buddhist and hindu texts into their languages  105 
after the 10th century  muslim central asian nomadic clans  using swift horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion  repeatedly overran south asia s north western plains  leading eventually to the establishment of the islamic delhi sultanate in 1206  106  the sultanate was to control much of north india and to make many forays into south india  although at first disruptive for the indian elites  the sultanate largely left its vast non muslim subject population to its own laws and customs  107  108  by repeatedly repulsing mongol raiders in the 13th century  the sultanate saved india from the devastation visited on west and central asia  setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers  learned men  mystics  traders  artists  and artisans from that region into the subcontinent  thereby creating a syncretic indo islamic culture in the north  109  110  the sultanate s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of south india paved the way for the indigenous vijayanagara empire  111  embracing a strong shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate  the empire came to control much of peninsular india  112  and was to influence south indian society for long afterwards  111 
in the early 16th century  northern india  then under mainly muslim rulers  113  fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of central asian warriors  114  the resulting mughal empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule  instead  it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices 115  116  and diverse and inclusive ruling elites  117  leading to more systematic  centralised  and uniform rule  118  eschewing tribal bonds and islamic identity  especially under akbar  the mughals united their far flung realms through loyalty  expressed through a persianised culture  to an emperor who had near divine status  117  the mughal state s economic policies  deriving most revenues from agriculture 119  and mandating that taxes be paid in the well regulated silver currency  120  caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets  118  the relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in india s economic expansion  118  resulting in greater patronage of painting  literary forms  textiles  and architecture  121  newly coherent social groups in northern and western india  such as the marathas  the rajputs  and the sikhs  gained military and governing ambitions during mughal rule  which  through collaboration or adversity  gave them both recognition and military experience  122  expanding commerce during mughal rule gave rise to new indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern india  122  as the empire disintegrated  many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs  123 
by the early 18th century  with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred  a number of european trading companies  including the english east india company  had established coastal outposts  124  125  the east india company s control of the seas  greater resources  and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the indian elite  these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other european companies  126  124  127  128  its further access to the riches of bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of india by the 1820s  129  india was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had  but was instead supplying the british empire with raw materials  many historians consider this to be the onset of india s colonial period  124  by this time  with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and having effectively been made an arm of british administration  the company began more consciously to enter non economic arenas like education  social reform  and culture  130 
historians consider india s modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885  the appointment in 1848 of lord dalhousie as governor general of the east india company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state  these included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty  the surveillance of the population  and the education of citizens  technological changes among them  railways  canals  and the telegraph were introduced not long after their introduction in europe  131  132  133  134  however  disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the indian rebellion of 1857  fed by diverse resentments and perceptions  including invasive british style social reforms  harsh land taxes  and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes  the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central india and shook the foundations of company rule  135  136  although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858  it led to the dissolution of the east india company and the direct administration of india by the british government  proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited british style parliamentary system  the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest  137  138  in the decades following  public life gradually emerged all over india  leading eventually to the founding of the indian national congress in 1885  139  140  141  142 
the rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far away markets  143  there was an increase in the number of large scale famines  144  and  despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by indian taxpayers  little industrial employment was generated for indians  145  there were also salutary effects  commercial cropping  especially in the newly canalled punjab  led to increased food production for internal consumption  146  the railway network provided critical famine relief  147  notably reduced the cost of moving goods  147  and helped nascent indian owned industry  146 
after world war i  in which approximately one million indians served  148  a new period began  it was marked by british reforms but also repressive legislation  by more strident indian calls for self rule  and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non co operation  of which mohandas karamchand gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol  149  during the 1930s  slow legislative reform was enacted by the british  the indian national congress won victories in the resulting elections  150  the next decade was beset with crises  indian participation in world war ii  the congress s final push for non co operation  and an upsurge of muslim nationalism  all were capped by the advent of independence in 1947  but tempered by the partition of india into two states  india and pakistan  151 
vital to india s self image as an independent nation was its constitution  completed in 1950  which put in place a secular and democratic republic  152  it has remained a democracy with civil liberties  an active supreme court  and a largely independent press  153  economic liberalisation  which began in the 1990s  has created a large urban middle class  transformed india into one of the world s fastest growing economies  154  and increased its geopolitical clout  indian movies  music  and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture  153  yet  india is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty  both rural and urban  153  by religious and caste related violence  155  by maoist inspired naxalite insurgencies  156  and by separatism in jammu and kashmir and in northeast india  157  it has unresolved territorial disputes with china 158  and with pakistan  158  india s sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world s newer nations  however  in spite of its recent economic successes  freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved  159 
india accounts for the bulk of the indian subcontinent  lying atop the indian tectonic plate  a part of the indo australian plate  160  india s defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the indian plate  then part of the southern supercontinent gondwana  began a north eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south west  and later  south and south east  160  simultaneously  the vast tethyan oceanic crust  to its northeast  began to subduct under the eurasian plate  160  these dual processes  driven by convection in the earth s mantle  both created the indian ocean and caused the indian continental crust eventually to under thrust eurasia and to uplift the himalayas  160  immediately south of the emerging himalayas  plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river borne sediment 161  and now constitutes the indo gangetic plain  162  cut off from the plain by the ancient aravalli range lies the thar desert  163 
the original indian plate survives as peninsular india  the oldest and geologically most stable part of india  it extends as far north as the satpura and vindhya ranges in central india  these parallel chains run from the arabian sea coast in gujarat in the west to the coal rich chota nagpur plateau in jharkhand in the east  164  to the south  the remaining peninsular landmass  the deccan plateau  is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the western and eastern ghats  165  the plateau contains the country s oldest rock formations  some over one billion years old  constituted in such fashion  india lies to the north of the equator between 6  44  and 35  30  north latitude i  and 68  7  and 97  25  east longitude  166 
india s coastline measures 7 517 kilometres  4 700 mi  in length  of this distance  5 423 kilometres  3 400 mi  belong to peninsular india and 2 094 kilometres  1 300 mi  to the andaman  nicobar  and lakshadweep island chains  167  according to the indian naval hydrographic charts  the mainland coastline consists of the following  43  sandy beaches  11  rocky shores  including cliffs  and 46  mudflats or marshy shores  167 
major himalayan origin rivers that substantially flow through india include the ganges and the brahmaputra  both of which drain into the bay of bengal  169  important tributaries of the ganges include the yamuna and the kosi  the latter s extremely low gradient  caused by long term silt deposition  leads to severe floods and course changes  170  171  major peninsular rivers  whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding  include the godavari  the mahanadi  the kaveri  and the krishna  which also drain into the bay of bengal  172  and the narmada and the tapti  which drain into the arabian sea  173  coastal features include the marshy rann of kutch of western india and the alluvial sundarbans delta of eastern india  the latter is shared with bangladesh  174  india has two archipelagos  the lakshadweep  coral atolls off india s south western coast  and the andaman and nicobar islands  a volcanic chain in the andaman sea  175 
the indian climate is strongly influenced by the himalayas and the thar desert  both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons  176  the himalayas prevent cold central asian katabatic winds from blowing in  keeping the bulk of the indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes  177  178  the thar desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture laden south west summer monsoon winds that  between june and october  provide the majority of india s rainfall  176  four major climatic groupings predominate in india  tropical wet  tropical dry  subtropical humid  and montane  179 
india is a megadiverse country  a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous  or endemic  to them  180  india is a habitat for 8 6  of all mammal species  13 7  of bird species  7 9  of reptile species  6  of amphibian species  12 2  of fish species  and 6 0  of all flowering plant species  181  182  fully a third of indian plant species are endemic  183  india also contains four of the world s 34 biodiversity hotspots  57  or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism  j  184 
india s forest cover is 701 673 km2  270 917 sq mi   which is 21 35  of the country s total land area  it can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density  or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy  185  very dense forest  whose canopy density is greater than 70   occupies 2 61  of india s land area  185  it predominates in the tropical moist forest of the andaman islands  the western ghats  and northeast india  186  moderately dense forest  whose canopy density is between 40  and 70   occupies 9 59  of india s land area  185  it predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the himalayas  the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern india  and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern india  186  open forest  whose canopy density is between 10  and 40   occupies 9 14  of india s land area  185  and predominates in the babul dominated thorn forest of the central deccan plateau and the western gangetic plain  186 
among the indian subcontinent s notable indigenous trees are the astringent azadirachta indica  or neem  which is widely used in rural indian herbal medicine  187  and the luxuriant ficus religiosa  or peepul  188  which is displayed on the ancient seals of mohenjo daro  189  and under which the buddha is recorded in the pali canon to have sought enlightenment  190 
many indian species have descended from those of gondwana  the southern supercontinent from which india separated more than 100 million years ago  192  india s subsequent collision with eurasia set off a mass exchange of species  however  volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic indian forms  193  still later  mammals entered india from asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the himalayas  186  this had the effect of lowering endemism among india s mammals  which stands at 12 6   contrasting with 45 8  among reptiles and 55 8  among amphibians  182  notable endemics are the vulnerable 194  hooded leaf monkey 195  and the threatened 196  beddom s toad 196  197  of the western ghats 
india contains 172 iucn designated threatened animal species  or 2 9  of endangered forms  198  these include the endangered bengal tiger and the ganges river dolphin  critically endangered species include  the gharial  a crocodilian  the great indian bustard  and the indian white rumped vulture  which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenac treated cattle  199  the pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered indian wildlife  in response  the system of national parks and protected areas  first established in 1935  was expanded substantially  in 1972  india enacted the wildlife protection act 200  and project tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness  the forest conservation act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988  201  india hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and thirteen biosphere reserves  202  four of which are part of the world network of biosphere reserves  twenty five wetlands are registered under the ramsar convention  203 
india is the world s most populous democracy  205  a parliamentary republic with a multi party system  206  it has eight recognised national parties  including the indian national congress and the bharatiya janata party  bjp   and more than 40 regional parties  207  the congress is considered centre left in indian political culture  208  and the bjp right wing  209  210  211  for most of the period between 1950 when india first became a republic and the late 1980s  the congress held a majority in the parliament  since then  however  it has increasingly shared the political stage with the bjp  212  as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi party coalition governments at the centre  213 
in the republic of india s first three general elections  in 1951  1957  and 1962  the jawaharlal nehru led congress won easy victories  on nehru s death in 1964  lal bahadur shastri briefly became prime minister  he was succeeded  after his own unexpected death in 1966  by nehru s daughter indira gandhi  who went on to lead the congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971  following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975  the congress was voted out of power in 1977  the then new janata party  which had opposed the emergency  was voted in  its government lasted just over two years  voted back into power in 1980  the congress saw a change in leadership in 1984  when indira gandhi was assassinated  she was succeeded by her son rajiv gandhi  who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year  the congress was voted out again in 1989 when a national front coalition  led by the newly formed janata dal in alliance with the left front  won the elections  that government too proved relatively short lived  lasting just under two years  214  elections were held again in 1991  no party won an absolute majority  the congress  as the largest single party  was able to form a minority government led by p  v  narasimha rao  215 
a two year period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996  several short lived alliances shared power at the centre  the bjp formed a government briefly in 1996  it was followed by two comparatively long lasting united front coalitions  which depended on external support  in 1998  the bjp was able to form a successful coalition  the national democratic alliance  nda   led by atal bihari vajpayee  the nda became the first non congress  coalition government to complete a five year term  216  again in the 2004 indian general elections  no party won an absolute majority  but the congress emerged as the largest single party  forming another successful coalition  the united progressive alliance  upa   it had the support of left leaning parties and mps who opposed the bjp  the upa returned to power in the 2009 general election with increased numbers  and it no longer required external support from india s communist parties  217  that year  manmohan singh became the first prime minister since jawaharlal nehru in 1957 and 1962 to be re elected to a consecutive five year term  218  in the 2014 general election  the bjp became the first political party since 1984 to win a majority and govern without the support of other parties  219  the incumbent prime minister is narendra modi  a former chief minister of gujarat  on 20 july 2017  ram nath kovind was elected india s 14th president and took the oath of office on 25 july 2017  220  221  222 
india is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the constitution of india the country s supreme legal document  it is a constitutional republic and representative democracy  in which  majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law   federalism in india defines the power distribution between the union and the states  the constitution of india  which came into effect on 26 january 1950  224  originally stated india to be a  sovereign  democratic republic   this characterisation was amended in 1971 to  a sovereign  socialist  secular  democratic republic   225  india s form of government  traditionally described as  quasi federal  with a strong centre and weak states  226  has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political  economic  and social changes  227  228

the most widely worn traditional dress in india  for both women and men  from ancient times until the advent of modern times  was draped  406  for women it eventually took the form of a sari  a single long piece of cloth  famously six yards long  and of width spanning the lower body  406  the sari is tied around the waist and knotted at one end  wrapped around the lower body  and then over the shoulder  406  in its more modern form  it has been used to cover the head  and sometimes the face  as a veil  406  it has been combined with an underskirt  or indian petticoat  and tucked in the waist band for more secure fastening  it is also commonly worn with an indian blouse  or choli  which serves as the primary upper body garment  the sari s end passing over the shoulder serving to obscure the upper body s contours and to cover the midriff  406 
for men  a similar but shorter length of cloth  the dhoti  has served as a lower body garment  407  it too is tied around the waist and wrapped  407  in south india  it is usually wrapped around the lower body  the upper end tucked in the waistband  the lower left free  in addition  in northern india  it is also wrapped once around each leg before being brought up through the legs to be tucked in at the back  other forms of traditional apparel that involve no stitching or tailoring are the chaddar  a shawl worn by both sexes to cover the upper body during colder weather  or a large veil worn by women for framing the head  or covering it  and the pagri  a turban or a scarf worn around the head as a part of a tradition  or to keep off the sun or the cold   407 
until the beginning of the first millennium ce  the ordinary dress of people in india was entirely unstitched  408  the arrival of the kushans from central asia  circa 48 ce  popularised cut and sewn garments in the style of central asian favoured by the elite in northern india  408  however  it was not until muslim rule was established  first with the delhi sultanate and then the mughal empire  that the range of stitched clothes in india grew and their use became significantly more widespread  408  among the various garments gradually establishing themselves in northern india during medieval and early modern times and now commonly worn are  the shalwars and pyjamas both forms of trousers  as well as the tunics kurta and kameez  408  in southern india  however  the traditional draped garments were to see much longer continuous use  408 
shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom  they are held up by a drawstring or elastic belt  which causes them to become pleated around the waist  409  the pants can be wide and baggy  or they can be cut quite narrow  on the bias  in which case they are called churidars  the kameez is a long shirt or tunic  410  the side seams are left open below the waist line  411    which gives the wearer greater freedom of movement  the kameez is usually cut straight and flat  older kameez use traditional cuts  modern kameez are more likely to have european inspired set in sleeves  the kameez may have a european style collar  a mandarin collar  or it may be collarless  in the latter case  its design as a women s garment is similar to a kurta  412  at first worn by muslim women  the use of shalwar kameez gradually spread  making them a regional style  413  414  especially in the punjab region  415   416 
a kurta  which traces its roots to central asian nomadic tunics  has evolved stylistically in india as a garment for everyday wear as well as for formal occasions  408  it is traditionally made of cotton or silk  it is worn plain or with embroidered decoration  such as chikan  and it can be loose or tight in the torso  typically falling either just above or somewhere below the wearer s knees  417  the sleeves of a traditional kurta fall to the wrist without narrowing  the ends hemmed but not cuffed  the kurta can be worn by both men and women  it is traditionally collarless  though standing collars are increasingly popular  and it can be worn over ordinary pyjamas  loose shalwars  churidars  or less traditionally over jeans  417 
in the last 50 years  fashions have changed a great deal in india  increasingly  in urban settings in northern india  the sari is no longer the apparel of everyday wear  transformed instead into one for formal occasions  418  the traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger women  who favour churidars or jeans  418  the kurtas worn by young men usually fall to the shins and are seldom plain  in white collar office settings  ubiquitous air conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year round  418  for weddings and formal occasions  men in the middle  and upper classes often wear bandgala  or short nehru jackets  with pants  with the groom and his groomsmen sporting sherwanis and churidars  418  the dhoti  the once universal garment of hindu india  the wearing of which in the homespun and handwoven form of khadi allowed gandhi to bring indian nationalism to the millions  419  is seldom seen in the cities  418  reduced now  with brocaded border  to the liturgical vestments of hindu priests 
indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines  given the range of diversity in soil type  climate  culture  ethnic groups  and occupations  these cuisines vary substantially from each other  using locally available spices  herbs  vegetables  and fruit  indian foodways have been influenced by religion  in particular hindu cultural choices and traditions  420  they have been also shaped by islamic rule  particularly that of the mughals  by the arrival of the portuguese on india s southwestern shores  and by british rule  these three influences are reflected  respectively  in the dishes of pilaf and biryani  the vindaloo  and the tiffin and the railway mutton curry  421  earlier  the columbian exchange had brought the potato  the tomato  maize  peanuts  cashew nuts  pineapples  guavas  and most notably  chilli peppers  to india  each became staples of use  422  in turn  the spice trade between india and europe was a catalyst for europe s age of discovery  423 
the cereals grown in india  their choice  times  and regions of planting  correspond strongly to the timing of india s monsoons  and the variation across regions in their associated rainfall  424  in general  the broad division of cereal zones in india  as determined by their dependence on rain  was firmly in place before the arrival of artificial irrigation  424  rice  which requires a lot of water  has been grown traditionally in regions of high rainfall in the northeast and the western coast  wheat in regions of moderate rainfall  like india s northern plains  and millet in regions of low rainfall  such as on the deccan plateau and in rajasthan  425  424 
the foundation of a typical indian meal is a cereal cooked in plain fashion  and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes  426  the latter includes lentils  pulses and vegetables spiced commonly with ginger and garlic  but also more discerningly with a combination of spices that may include coriander  cumin  turmeric  cinnamon  cardamon and others as informed by culinary conventions  426  in an actual meal  this mental representation takes the form of a platter  or thali  with a central place for the cooked cereal  peripheral ones  often in small bowls  for the flavourful accompaniments  and the simultaneous  rather than piecemeal  ingestion of the two in each act of eating  whether by actual mixing for example of rice and lentils or in the folding of one such as bread around the other  such as cooked vegetables  426 
a notable feature of indian food is the existence of a number of distinctive vegetarian cuisines  each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its adherents  427  the appearance of ahimsa  or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many religious orders early in indian history  especially upanishadic hinduism  buddhism and jainism  is thought to have been a notable factor in the prevalence of vegetarianism among a segment of india s hindu population  especially in southern india  gujarat  and the hindi speaking belt of north central india  as well as among jains  427  among these groups  strong discomfort is felt at thoughts of eating meat  428  and contributes to the low proportional consumption of meat to overall diet in india  428  unlike china  which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially in its years of increased economic growth  in india the strong dietary traditions have contributed to dairy  rather than meat  becoming the preferred form of animal protein consumption accompanying higher economic growth  429 
in the last millennium  the most significant import of cooking techniques into india occurred during the mughal empire  the cultivation of rice had spread much earlier from india to central and west asia  however  it was during mughal rule that dishes  such as the pilaf  425  developed in the interim during the abbasid caliphate  430  and cooking techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt  spread into northern india from regions to its northwest  431  to the simple yogurt marinade of persia  onions  garlic  almonds  and spices began to be added in india  431  rice grown to the southwest of the mughal capital  agra  which had become famous in the islamic world for its fine grain  was partially cooked and layered alternately with the sauteed meat  the pot sealed tightly  and slow cooked according to another persian cooking technique  to produce what has today become the indian biryani  431  a feature of festive dining in many parts of india  432  in food served in restaurants in urban north india  and internationally  the diversity of indian food has been partially concealed by the dominance of punjabi cuisine  this was caused in large part by an entrepreneurial response among people from the punjab region who had been displaced by the 1947 partition of india  and had arrived in india as refugees  427  the identification of indian cuisine with the tandoori chicken cooked in the tandoor oven  which had traditionally been used for baking bread in the rural punjab and the delhi region  especially among muslims  but which is originally from central asia dates to this period  427
