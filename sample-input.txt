some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in south asia originated from areas encompassing present day pakistan  44  the earliest known inhabitants in the region were soanian during the lower paleolithic  of whom stone tools have been found in the soan valley of punjab  45  the indus region  which covers most of present day pakistan  was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the neolithic mehrgarh 46  and the bronze age indus valley civilisation 47  48  49  50  51   2 800 1 800 bce  at harappa and mohenjo daro  52  53 
the vedic period  1500 500 bce  was characterised by an indo aryan culture  during this period the vedas  the oldest scriptures associated with hinduism  were composed  and this culture later became well established in the region  54  55  multan was an important hindu pilgrimage centre  56  the vedic civilisation flourished in the ancient gandh?ran city of tak?a?il?  now taxila in the punjab  which was founded around 1000 bce  57  46  successive ancient empires and kingdoms ruled the region  the persian achaemenid empire  around 519 bce   alexander the great s empire in 326 bce 58  and the maurya empire  founded by chandragupta maurya and extended by ashoka the great  until 185 bce  46  the indo greek kingdom founded by demetrius of bactria  180 165 bce  included gandhara and punjab and reached its greatest extent under menander  165 150 bce   prospering the greco buddhist culture in the region  46  59  taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world  which was established during the late vedic period in 6th century bce  60  61  the school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was provided on an individualistic basis  61  the ancient university was documented by the invading forces of alexander the great and was also recorded by chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century ce  62  63  64  65 
at its zenith  the rai dynasty  489 632 ce  of sindh ruled this region and the surrounding territories  66  the pala dynasty was the last buddhist empire  which  under dharmapala and devapala  stretched across south asia from what is now bangladesh through northern india to pakistan 
the arab conqueror muhammad bin qasim conquered sindh in 711 ce  67  68  69  70  71  the pakistan government s official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of pakistan was laid 67  72  73  but the concept of pakistan came in 19th century  the early medieval period  642 1219 ce  witnessed the spread of islam in the region  during this period  sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional buddhist and hindu population to islam  74  these developments set the stage for the rule of several successive muslim empires in the region  including the ghaznavid empire  975 1187 ce   the ghorid kingdom  and the delhi sultanate  1206 1526 ce   the lodi dynasty  the last of the delhi sultanate  was replaced by the mughal empire  1526 1857 ce  
the mughals introduced persian literature and high culture  establishing the roots of indo persian culture in the region  75  from the region of modern day pakistan  key cities during the mughal rule were lahore and thatta  76  both of which were chosen as the site of impressive mughal buildings  77  in the early 16th century  the region remained under the mughal empire ruled by muslim emperors  78  by the early 18th century  increasing european influence contributed to the slow disintegration of the mughal empire as the lines between commercial and political dominance became increasingly blurred  78 
during this time  the english east india company had established coastal outposts  78  control over the seas  greater resources  technology  and british military protection led the company to increasingly flex its military muscle  allowing the company to gain control over the subcontinent by 1765 and sideline european competitors  79  expanding access beyond bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of region by the 1820s  78  many historians see this as the start of the region s colonial period  78  by this time  with its economic power severely curtailed by the british parliament and itself effectively made an arm of british administration  the company began more deliberately to enter non economic arenas such as education  social reform  and culture  78  such reforms included the enforcement of the english education act in 1835 and the introduction of the indian civil service  ics   80  traditional madrasahs primary institutions of higher learning for muslims in the subcontinent were no longer supported by the english crown  and nearly all of the madrasahs lost their financial endowment  81 
the gradual decline of the mughal empire in the early 18th century enabled the sikh empire to control larger areas until the british east india company gained ascendancy over south asia  82  a rebellion in 1857 called the sepoy mutiny of bengal was the region s major armed struggle against the british empire and queen victoria  83  divergence in the relationship between hinduism and islam created a major rift in british india that led to motivated religious violence in british india  84  the language controversy further escalated the tensions between hindus and muslims  85  the hindu renaissance witnessed an awakening of intellectualism in traditional hinduism and saw the emergence of more assertive influence in the social and political spheres in british india  86  87  a muslim intellectual movement  founded by sir syed ahmed khan to counter the hindu renaissance  envisioned  as well as advocated for the two nation theory  82  and led to the creation of the all india muslim league in 1906  in contrast to the indian national congress s anti british efforts  the muslim league was a pro british movement whose political program inherited the british values that would shape pakistan s future civil society  88  in events during world war i  british intelligence foiled an anti english conspiracy involving the nexus of congress and the german empire  citation needed  the largely non violent independence struggle led by the indian congress engaged millions of protesters in mass campaigns of civil disobedience in the 1920s and 1930s against the british empire  89  90  91 
the muslim league slowly rose to mass popularity in the 1930s amid fears of under representation and neglect of british muslims in politics  in his presidential address of 29 december 1930  allama iqbal called for  the amalgamation of north west muslim majority indian states  consisting of punjab  north west frontier province  sind  and baluchistan  92  the perceived neglect of muslim interests by congress led british provincial governments during the period of 1937 39 convinced muhammad ali jinnah  the founder of pakistan to espouse the two nation theory and led the muslim league to adopt the lahore resolution of 1940 presented by sher e bangla a k  fazlul haque  popularly known as the pakistan resolution  82  in world war ii  jinnah and british educated founding fathers in the muslim league supported the united kingdom s war efforts  countering opposition against it whilst working towards sir syed s vision  93 
the 1946 elections resulted in the muslim league winning 90 percent of the seats reserved for muslims  thus  the 1946 election was effectively a plebiscite in which the indian muslims were to vote on the creation of pakistan  a plebiscite won by the muslim league  94  this victory was assisted by the support given to the muslim league by the support of the landowners of sindh and punjab  the congress  which initially denied the muslim league s claim of being the sole representative of indian muslims  was now forced to recognise the fact  94  the british had no alternative except to take jinnah s views into account as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson of the entirety of british india s muslims  however  the british did not want colonial india to be partitioned  and in one last effort to prevent it  they devised the cabinet mission plan  95 
as the cabinet mission failed  the british government announced its intention to end the british rule in 1946 47  96  nationalists in british india including jawaharlal nehru and abul kalam azad of congress  jinnah of the all india muslim league  and master tara singh representing the sikhs agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and independence in june 1947 with the viceroy of india  lord mountbatten of burma  97  as the united kingdom agreed to the partitioning of india in 1947  the modern state of pakistan was established on 14 august 1947  27th of ramadan in 1366 of the islamic calendar   amalgamating the muslim majority eastern and northwestern regions of british india  91  it comprised the provinces of balochistan  east bengal  the north west frontier province  west punjab  and sindh  82  97 
in the riots that accompanied the partition in punjab province  it is believed that between 200 000 and 2 000 000 98  99  100  101  102  103  people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions 104  105  while 50 000 muslim women were abducted and raped by hindu and sikh men and 33 000 hindu and sikh women also experienced the same fate at the hands of muslims  106  107  108  109  around 6 5 million muslims moved from india to west pakistan and 4 7 million hindus and sikhs moved from west pakistan to india  110  it was the largest mass migration in human history  111  112  113  a subsequent dispute over the princely state of jammu and kashmir eventually sparked the indo pakistani war of 1947 1948  114  115 
 muhammad ali jinnah s first speech to the constituent assembly of pakistan 116 
after independence in 1947  jinnah  the president of the muslim league  became the nation s first governor general as well as the first president speaker of the parliament  citation needed  but he died of tuberculosis on 11 september 1948  117  meanwhile  pakistan s founding fathers agreed to appoint liaquat ali khan  the secretary general of the party  the nation s first prime minister  with dominion status in the commonwealth of nations  independent pakistan had two british monarchs before it became a republic  citation needed 
the creation of pakistan was never fully accepted by many british leaders  among them lord mountbatten  118  mountbatten clearly expressed his lack of support and faith in the muslim league s idea of pakistan  119  jinnah refused mountbatten s offer to serve as governor general of pakistan  120  when mountbatten was asked by collins and lapierre if he would have sabotaged pakistan had he known that jinnah was dying of tuberculosis  he replied  most probably   121 
maulana shabbir ahmad usmani  a respected deobandi alim  scholar  who occupied the position of shaykh al islam in pakistan in 1949  and maulana mawdudi of jamaat i islami played a pivotal role in the demand for an islamic constitution  mawdudi demanded that the constituent assembly make an explicit declaration affirming the  supreme sovereignty of god  and the supremacy of the shariah in pakistan  122 
a significant result of the efforts of the jamaat i islami and the ulama was the passage of the objectives resolution in march 1949  the objectives resolution  which liaquat ali khan called the second most important step in pakistan s history  declared that  sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to god almighty alone and the authority which he has delegated to the state of pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by him is a sacred trust   the objectives resolution has been incorporated as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956  1962  and 1973  123 
democracy was stalled by the martial law that had been enforced by president iskander mirza  who was replaced by the army chief  general ayub khan  after adopting a presidential system in 1962  the country experienced exceptional growth until a second war with india in 1965 that led to an economic downturn and wide scale public disapproval in 1967  124  125  consolidating control from ayub khan in 1969  president yahya khan had to deal with a devastating cyclone that caused 500 000 deaths in east pakistan  126 
in 1970 pakistan held its first democratic elections since independence  meant to mark a transition from military rule to democracy  but after the east pakistani awami league won against the pakistan peoples party  ppp   yahya khan and the military establishment refused to hand over power  127  128  operation searchlight  a military crackdown on the bengali nationalist movement  led to a declaration of independence and the waging of a war of liberation by the bengali mukti bahini forces in east pakistan  128  129  which in west pakistan was described as a civil war as opposed to a war of liberation  130 
independent researchers estimate that between 300 000 and 500 000 civilians died during this period while the bangladesh government puts the number of dead at three million  131  a figure that is now nearly universally regarded as excessively inflated  132  some academics such as rudolph rummel and rounaq jahan say both sides 133  committed genocide  others such as richard sisson and leo e  rose believe there was no genocide  134  in response to india s support for the insurgency in east pakistan  preemptive strikes on india by pakistan s air force  navy  and marines sparked a conventional war in 1971 that resulted in an indian victory and east pakistan gaining independence as bangladesh  128 
with pakistan surrendering in the war  yahya khan was replaced by zulfikar ali bhutto as president  the country worked towards promulgating its constitution and putting the country on the road to democracy  democratic rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 an era of self consciousness  intellectual leftism  nationalism  and nationwide reconstruction  135  in 1972 pakistan embarked on an ambitious plan to develop its nuclear deterrence capability with the goal of preventing any foreign invasion  the country s first nuclear power plant was inaugurated in that same year  136  137  accelerated in response to india s first nuclear test in 1974  this crash program was completed in 1979  137 
democracy ended with a military coup in 1977 against the leftist ppp  which saw general zia ul haq become the president in 1978  from 1977 to 1988  president zia s corporatisation and economic islamisation initiatives led to pakistan becoming one of the fastest growing economies in south asia  138  while building up the country s nuclear program  increasing islamisation  139  and the rise of a homegrown conservative philosophy  pakistan helped subsidise and distribute us resources to factions of the mujahideen against the ussr s intervention in communist afghanistan  140  141  pakistan s north west frontier province became a base for the anti soviet afghan fighters  with the province s influential deobandi ulama playing a significant role in encouraging and organising the  jihad   142 
president zia died in a plane crash in 1988  and benazir bhutto  daughter of zulfikar ali bhutto  was elected as the country s first female prime minister  the ppp was followed by conservative pakistan muslim league  n   and over the next decade the leaders of the two parties fought for power  alternating in office while the country s situation worsened  economic indicators fell sharply  in contrast to the 1980s  this period is marked by prolonged stagflation  instability  corruption  nationalism  geopolitical rivalry with india  and the clash of left wing right wing ideologies  143  144  as pml  n  secured a supermajority in elections in 1997  sharif authorised nuclear testings  see chagai i and chagai ii   as a retaliation to the second nuclear tests ordered by india  led by prime minister atal bihari vajpayee in may 1998  145 
military tension between the two countries in the kargil district led to the kargil war of 1999  and turmoil in civic military relations allowed general pervez musharraf to take over through a bloodless coup d état  146  147  musharraf governed pakistan as chief executive from 1999 to 2001 and as president from 2001 to 2008 a period of enlightenment  social liberalism  extensive economic reforms  148  and direct involvement in the us led war on terrorism  when the national assembly historically completed its first full five year term on 15 november 2007  the new elections were called by the election commission  149 
after the assassination of benazir bhutto in 2007  the ppp secured the most votes in the elections of 2008  appointing party member yousaf raza gillani as prime minister  150  threatened with impeachment  president musharraf resigned on 18 august 2008  and was succeeded by asif ali zardari  151  152  153  clashes with the judicature prompted gillani s disqualification from the parliament and as the prime minister in june 2012  154  by its own financial calculations  pakistan s involvement in the war on terrorism has cost up to  118 billion  155  sixty thousand casualties and more than 1 8 million displaced civilians  156  the general election held in 2013 saw the pml  n  almost achieve a supermajority  following which nawaz sharif was elected as the prime minister  returning to the post for the third time in fourteen years  in a democratic transition  157  in 2018  imran khan  the chairman of pti  won the 2018 pakistan general election with 116 general seats and became the 22nd prime minister of pakistan in election of national assembly of pakistan for prime minister by getting 176 votes against shehbaz sharif  the chairman of pml  n   who got 96 votes  158 
pakistan is the only country to have been created in the name of islam  17  18  the idea of pakistan  which had received overwhelming popular support among indian muslims  especially those in the provinces of british india where muslims were in a minority such as the united provinces  159  was articulated in terms of an islamic state by the muslim league leadership  the ulama  islamic clergy  and jinnah  160  jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama and upon his death was described by one such alim  maulana shabbir ahmad usmani  as the greatest muslim after aurangzeb and as someone who desired to unite the muslims of the world under the banner of islam  161  162 
the objectives resolution in march 1949  which declared god as the sole sovereign over the entire universe  represented the first formal step to transform pakistan into an islamic state  163  123  muslim league leader chaudhry khaliquzzaman asserted that pakistan could only truly become an islamic state after bringing all believers of islam into a single political unit  164  keith callard  one of the earliest scholars on pakistani politics  observed that pakistanis believed in the essential unity of purpose and outlook in the muslim world and assumed that muslim from other countries would share their views on the relationship between religion and nationality  165 
however  pakistan s pan islamist sentiments for a united islamic bloc called islamistan were not shared by other muslim governments  166  although islamists such as the grand mufti of palestine  al haj amin al husseini  and leaders of the muslim brotherhood  became drawn to the country  pakistan s desire for an international organization of muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the organization of islamic conference  oic  was formed  167 
the strongest opposition to the islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the state came from the bengali muslims of east pakistan 168  whose educated class  according to a survey by social scientist nasim ahmad jawed  preferred secularism and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated west pakistanis who tended to prefer an islamic identity  169  the islamist party jamaat e islami considered pakistan to be an islamic state and believed bengali nationalism to be unacceptable  in the 1971 conflict over east pakistan  the jamaat e islami fought the bengali nationalists on the pakistan army s side  170 
after pakistan s first ever general elections the 1973 constitution was created by an elected parliament  171  the constitution declared pakistan an islamic republic and islam as the state religion  it also stated that all laws would have to be brought into accordance with the injunctions of islam as laid down in the quran and sunnah and that no law repugnant to such injunctions could be enacted  172  the 1973 constitution also created certain institutions such as the shariat court and the council of islamic ideology to channel the interpretation and application of islam  173 
pakistan s leftist prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto faced vigorous opposition which coalesced into a movement united under the revivalist banner of nizam e mustafa   rule of the prophet   174  which aimed to establish an islamic state based on sharia laws  bhutto agreed to some islamist demands before being overthrown in a coup  175 
in 1977  after taking power from bhutto in a coup d état  general zia ul haq  who came from a religious background  176  committed himself to establishing an islamic state and enforcing sharia law  175  zia established separate shariat judicial courts 177  and court benches 178  179  to judge legal cases using islamic doctrine  180  zia bolstered the influence of the ulama  islamic clergy  and the islamic parties  180  zia ul haq forged a strong alliance between the military and deobandi institutions 181  and even though most barelvi ulama 182  and only a few deobandi scholars had supported pakistan s creation  islamic state politics came to be mostly in favour of deobandi  and later ahl e hadith salafi  institutions instead of barelvi  183  sectarian tensions increased with zia s anti shia policies  184 
according to a pew research center  pew  opinion poll  a majority of pakistanis support making sharia the official law of the land  185  in a survey of several muslim countries  pew also found that pakistanis tend to identify with their religion more than their nationality in contrast to muslims in other nations such as egypt  indonesia and jordan  186 
the geography and climate of pakistan are extremely diverse  and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife  187  pakistan covers an area of 881 913 km2  340 509 sq mi   approximately equal to the combined land areas of france and the united kingdom  it is the 33rd largest nation by total area  although this ranking varies depending on how the disputed territory of kashmir is counted  pakistan has a 1 046 km  650 mi  coastline along the arabian sea and the gulf of oman in the south 188  and land borders of 6 774 km  4 209 mi  in total  2 430 km  1 510 mi  with afghanistan  523 km  325 mi  with china  2 912 km  1 809 mi  with india and 909 km  565 mi  with iran  189  it shares a marine border with oman  190  and is separated from tajikistan by the cold  narrow wakhan corridor  191  pakistan occupies a geopolitically important location at the crossroads of south asia  the middle east  and central asia  192 
geologically  pakistan is located in the indus tsangpo suture zone and overlaps the indian tectonic plate in its sindh and punjab provinces  balochistan and most of khyber pakhtunkhwa are within the eurasian plate  mainly on the iranian plateau  gilgit baltistan and azad kashmir lie along the edge of the indian plate and hence are prone to violent earthquakes  this region has the highest rates of seismicity and the largest earthquakes in the himalaya region  193  ranging from the coastal areas of the south to the glaciated mountains of the north  pakistan s landscapes vary from plains to deserts  forests  hills  and plateaus  194 
pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas  the northern highlands  the indus river plain  and the balochistan plateau  195  the northern highlands contain the karakoram  hindu kush  and pamir mountain ranges  see mountains of pakistan   which contain some of the world s highest peaks  including five of the fourteen eight thousanders  mountain peaks over 8 000 metres or 26 250 feet   which attract adventurers and mountaineers from all over the world  notably k2  8 611 m or 28 251 ft  and nanga parbat  8 126 m or 26 660 ft   196  the balochistan plateau lies in the west and the thar desert in the east  the 1 609 km  1 000 mi  indus river and its tributaries flow through the country from the kashmir region to the arabian sea  there is an expanse of alluvial plains along it in the punjab and sindh  197 
the climate varies from tropical to temperate  with arid conditions in the coastal south  there is a monsoon season with frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall  and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at all  there are four distinct seasons in pakistan  a cool  dry winter from december through february  a hot  dry spring from march through may  the summer rainy season  or southwest monsoon period  from june through september  and the retreating monsoon period of october and november  82  rainfall varies greatly from year to year  and patterns of alternate flooding and drought are common  198 
the diversity of the landscape and climate in pakistan allows a wide variety of trees and plants to flourish  the forests range from coniferous alpine and subalpine trees such as spruce  pine  and deodar cedar in the extreme northern mountains to deciduous trees in most of the country  for example  the mulberry like shisham found in the sulaiman mountains   to palms such as coconut and date in the southern punjab  southern balochistan  and all of sindh  the western hills are home to juniper  tamarisk  coarse grasses  and scrub plants  mangrove forests form much of the coastal wetlands along the coast in the south  199 
coniferous forests are found at altitudes ranging from 1 000 to 4 000 metres  3 300 to 13 100 feet  in most of the northern and northwestern highlands  in the xeric regions of balochistan  date palm and ephedra are common  in most of the punjab and sindh  the indus plains support tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forest as well as tropical and xeric shrublands  these forests are mostly of mulberry  acacia  and eucalyptus  200  about 2 2  or 1 687 000 hectares  16 870 km2  of pakistan was forested in 2010  201
